# Rubik's Programming Language

> Programming language based on Rubik's cubes that operates on a 2D plane with 3D storage

# RPL Opcodes
> These are 3 character control codes that let you do things

## Math
 - Addition = ADD
 - Subtraction = SUB
 - Multiplication = MUL
 - Division = DIV
 - Negate = NEG

## Pointer
 - Pointer Move Forward = OPF
 - Pointer Move Backward = OPB
 - Pointer Move Left = OPL
 - Pointer Move Right = OPR

## Rubik's Notation
 - CW = Clockwise
 - CCW = Counterclockwise

 - Move Left Face CW = MOV L
 - Move Right Face CW = MOV R
 - Move Top CW = MOV U
 - Move Bottom CW = MOV D
 - Move Face CW = MOV F
 - Move Back CW = MOV B

 - Move Left Face CCW = MOV LN
 - Move Right Face CCW = MOV RN
 - Move Top CCW = MOV UN
 - Move Bottom CCW = MOV DN
 - Move Face CCW = MOVE FN
 - Move Back CCW = MOV BN
